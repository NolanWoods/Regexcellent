* Regexcellent

This project will be a web-based tool for mangling text with regexes and possibly other clever things.

Project bootstrapping:
- Initial git and npm
- Gulp
- ... with CoffeeScript!
- TravisCI?
- EditorSettings?

First-pass tasks:
- Get a web page that can execute a regex and show matches.
- Using Angular.js? For now, at any rate.
